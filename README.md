This repo holds the project files from my exploration into using DMX to control audio-reactive motion graphics in Unreal Engine's Motion Design.

This is just the basics to get you started. From this point you can add Cloners, Effectors, and adjust any properties to like to create whatever ideas you have and have them move to your music.

You can learn more about this Tech-Multiverse project at the following resources.

## Unreal Engine Project
The UE 5.6.0 project files are in the "UE" folder.  

This contains a simple scene with a single Cloner and Effector. The Effector is set up to listen for DMX data coming from localhost.

## TouchDesigner Project
The TouchDesigner project file located in the "TD" folder takes audio input and converts that to DMX data.

You can alter this project to use any input you like and add any channels you might need for your project   

**See project resources above for how I set everything up.**
